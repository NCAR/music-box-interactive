        Simulate chamber or flow-tube experiments, recreate field observations, or
        evalute the effects of new chemistry on an existing system. MusicBox is designed to
        let you build the chemical system you want. You can simulate that system for the
        conditions you're interested in, and evalute the results.
      </p>
      <p class="lead text-muted">
        When you're ready,
        communicate your new chemical system to the community, so it can run in any
        partner model.
